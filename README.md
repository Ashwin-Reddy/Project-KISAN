# Project-KISAN
## My First Tkinter Python Project
The main idea is to create a Python with SQL connectivity program which has the below listed details for the need of a villager.
In the rising times of technology, making a program so that they could track each part of their farming growth, is something essential.

The below ones are the concepts listed in this project:
- Tracking of prices of items in the market.
-	Maintaining their income and calculating every cropâ€™s profit.
-	Displaying calling details of transport by comparing the price per kilometre.
